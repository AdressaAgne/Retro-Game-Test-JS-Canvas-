![Game Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/BQoqON7.png "Game Screenshot")

This is a test to see if i could make a game in canvas. I want to make a game for my Web Development Bacholer Assignment, so this is to see if i got the skills to pay the bills or rather get an A

## Controlls:
**w** : up

**a** : left

**s** : down

**d** : right

**e** : pick up item / search wall

**q** : use selected invetory item

**0-9** : Invetory Select


## Maps
All maps are 16x16 gifs, each color is a type of block or item.

Ofcourse the maps can be bigger then 16x16, but the screen is based on the map size, so the game might be a bit small...
i'm working on a moving camera function, after that there should be no problem having a 256x256 map if you wanted.

Colors for blocks can be found here: [Photoshop Swatch File](https://assets.adobe.com/link/26950955-15df-4394-64b3-8b226ca15dbb)
